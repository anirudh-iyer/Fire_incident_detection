# Fire_incident_detection

Project Summary:

This project focuses on visualizing fire incident data using a geographical hexbin plot. The data is sourced from a CSV file, where fire incidents are recorded along with their geographical coordinates (longitude and latitude). By using hexbin plots, the project effectively represents dense areas of incidents, providing a clear view of fire distribution across various regions.

Tech Stack Used:

Python: Programming language for data analysis and visualization.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and loading the CSV file.
Matplotlib: Utilized to create the hexbin plot for visualizing geographical data.
NumPy: Employed for numerical computations and efficient handling of array-based operations.
